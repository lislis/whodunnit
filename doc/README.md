Facts and rules make up knowledge bases. Knowledge bases describe some collection of relationships we find interesting.

Rules state information that is conditionally true of the situation of interest.

More generally, the :- should be read as “if”, or “is implied by”.

 If a knowledge base contains a rule head  :-  body, and Prolog knows that body follows from the information in the knowledge base, then Prolog can infer head.

This fundamental deduction step is called modus ponens.

The facts and rules contained in a knowledge base are called clauses.

predicates are the concepts we find important, and the various clauses we write down concerning them are our attempts to pin down what they mean and how they are inter-related.

CFG - Context Free Grammars

DCG - definite clause grammars

Terminal vs non-terminal symbols

Context free rule: non-terminal symbol -> finite sequence made up of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols

To put it another way, a recogniser is a program that correctly classifies strings as grammatical or ungrammatical (relative to some grammar).
