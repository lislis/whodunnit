This post is mostly about two games: Clue and Murdle. Where Clue represents the base idea of what I want to archieve game-wise and Murdle being more than I could ever hope to archieve.

## Cluedo

[Cluedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo) is THE board game version of the Whodunit-genre.

A murder happened in a huge manison and the players need to deduce the perpetrator, the murder weapon and location from a limited pool of options (Six suspects, six weapons and nine locations, 324 possibilities according to Wikipedia), while also being part of the pool of suspects themselves.

The facts (as in cards that are _not_ part of the murder scenario) are distributed among the players. The complete knowledge is inaccessible because it is distributed, the players have to make false accusations that are then countered by others to gain more knowledge facts. Players note down facts on a deduction sheet, which helps them to sooner or later make the final accusation.

Notable to me are a two things. The most important constraint for this game is that there is only one weapon and one location per perpetrator. None of which can be shared. I believe this is to make deduction possible at all (without computational help), but it could be interesting to break with this base constraint. But not for now.

The other is how a relatively small set of options results in a pretty large set of possible outcomes. (Math!) Which is good news for feeding initial data for generation into the system.

On a side note, I love the world building of the board game. There is not much story, but give it a Victorian style mansion and British-colonial inspired aristocrats and some working class characters and you can spin endless drama plots in this. Fascinating!

## Murdle

When I first came up with the idea of Whodunnit, I didn't yet know about Murdle. I pitched my idea to a friend and they were like: "Have you played [Murdle](https://murdle.com/), I think you would like it."

I don't just like it, I love it.

It's also basically a fully fleshed out, brilliantly shiny version of my idea. But in the browser. So yeah. That helped keeping me motivated ... not.

Murdle builds upon the Cluedo principles, but with the [Worlde](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) twist of only giving you once mystery to solve per day. Come back tomorrow for the next!

Not just that though, the mysteries get more complex throughout the week. Starting with three suspects, three locations and three weapons, you'll end up with four suspects, four weapons, four locations and four motives.

The clues for deduction are all presented up front, which is the only piece that I could hope to improve up eventually (unlocking clues and thus progressing through the mystery).

The clues are presented in different formats, too. From plainly stating a fact to being used togther with other clues to deduce another fact. They play with properties of the suspects, weapons, locations and motives.

For example, one clue could be there were wood spliters found at one location. And two possible weapons are made from wood. But one weapon is heavy and one is light. Then maybe it is revealed that one suspect can only lift light weapons, therefore we can deduce that it was them with this weapon at this location.

I would love to look into the inner workings of Murdle, especially how the text-fragments are generated and the logic for balancing the various degrees of difficulty. I could imagine there is some logic programming somewhere in there. I will never know though because the About-section website says:

> The daily murdles are generated by MORIARTY, a proprietary algorithm capable of planning a 1,000,000 murders a minute.

Womp, womp. But they sell books with the mysteries, too. So I guess that's somehow justified.
