It might come as a surprise but Prolog is not the most mainstream language. Which is probably the reason why there are not that many in-depth resources for learning it.

However, Prolog is taught in quite a few computer science programs and is genuinely and interesting language. Which is probably why there is a couple of really nice and quirkly projects out there.
