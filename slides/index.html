      Calling out to Prolog

      ```rust
      pub fn query_prolog(&self) -> Result<std::process::Output, std::io::Error> {
            let child = Command::new("swipl")
            .arg("-s")
            .arg(&self.db_path)
            .arg("-g")
            .arg(&self.prolog_string)
            .arg("-g")

      # Future work

      # Future work aka making it work

      --

      - Fix the Prolog code

      --

      - Rewrite knowledge base initiation to be two-step (not part of the presentation)

      --

      - Rewrite Prolog query code to unify more than X
